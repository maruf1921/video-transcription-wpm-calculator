# video-transcription-wpm-calculator

A simple web application that allows users to upload a video, extract its audio, transcribe the audio into Bengali text, and calculate the words per minute (WPM) based on the transcription. This project uses Flask for the backend (audio extraction, transcription) and React for the frontend (file upload and result display). It provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for processing videos and analyzing transcriptions.
